# basket-analysis
The objective of this repository is to analyze a purchase basket composition, understand the strongest rules through "arules" R pks and make cross-selling recommendations based on these rules.

R was used to run the analysis, while the report was written in HTML using "Markdown" pkg.

Any tips, question, reccomendation regarding the analysis and the way the report format is welcome. 

Peace! :)
